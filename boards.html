    ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) explores the theory and development of tools that simulate thinking, patterning and
    advanced
    decision behaviors through software running on computing devices. AI applications can solve and navigate complex
    scenarios
    that require drawing inferences appropriate to situations, performing decision-making using complex and changing
    data,
    discovering meaning and generalizing conclusions based on learned events and from experience. AI approaches within
    software form the underpinnings of autonomous devices, such as self-driving vehicles and drones. Technologies such
    as big
    data analysis, voice recognition, simulation agents and IoT devices all require AI algorithms. Studies in UATâ€™s
    Artificial
    Intelligence degree cover the fundamentals of general and applied AI, including core programming languages and
    platforms
    used in computer science. Advanced coursework encompasses applying principles of natural language processing,
    machine
    learning, behavior simulation and deep learning based on big data sets. Students prepare for future-oriented AI uses
    by
    applying computer science approaches and AI concepts as they develop solutions to real-world projects within
    production
    studio settings. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Artificial Intelligence is 11.0102.
    ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEGREE OBJECTIVES
    1. Create, analyze and integrate artificial intelligence applications and IoT systems.
    2. Demonstrate proficiency in the design and development of natural language processing systems.
    3. Demonstrate the skills required to design and create machine learning systems using best practices and patterns.
    4. Demonstrate new and original data in deep learning by consuming big data with original algorithms.
    5. Demonstrate software development skills using more than one programming language, development environment,
    platform, and source control system.
    6. Describe, develop, analyze and integrate data structures, databases, and database management systems.
